# Project Title: Challenge 1

## Project Objective:

The objective of this project was to make the code written by the previous programmers more accessible while also refactoring it to show a logical flow. I achieved this by making the text more semantically sound, which makes it easier for other programmers to grasp where the project's most important components are located and to follow a clear flow.
